Code repository of my MSc of Bioinformatics thesis 

"*An exploratory analysis of the spread and structure of acetyltransferases in* Pseudomonas *phages*"

Research conducted at the lab of Computational Systems Biology of prof. Vera van Noort and the lab of Gene Technology of prof. Rob Lavigne with daily supervision by [Hannelore Longin](https://github.com/hannelorelongin).

Each distinct folder of this repository corresponds to a separate stage of this project.
1. `Mining`: Genome and proteome mining of N-acetyltransferases in *Pseudomonas* phages using HMM-based sequence scanning methods.
2. `AlphaFold`: Generating AlphaFold2 protein structure models of the mining hits to check for the presence of typical structural features and get a grasp of any existing structural diversity.
3. `Docking`: Docking acetyl-CoA in the AlphaFold models to estimate the acetyltransferase's functionality in correlation with its structural features.
